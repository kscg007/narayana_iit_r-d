Here are example systemd service files for both Celery Worker and Celery Beat configured for your project setup:
1. celery-worker.service

Create or edit /etc/systemd/system/celery-worker.service with:

ini

Copy Code
[Unit]
Description=Celery Worker Service
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=nspira_sel_ub_01
Group=nspira_sel_ub_01
WorkingDirectory=/home/nspira_sel_ub_01/Documents/photo_app/photo
ExecStart=/home/nspira_sel_ub_01/Documents/photo_app/myen/bin/celery -A photo worker -l info
Restart=always
RestartSec=10

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

2. celery-beat.service

Create or edit /etc/systemd/system/celery-beat.service with:

ini

Copy Code
[Unit]
Description=Celery Beat Service
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=nspira_sel_ub_01
Group=nspira_sel_ub_01
WorkingDirectory=/home/nspira_sel_ub_01/Documents/photo_app/photo
ExecStart=/home/nspira_sel_ub_01/Documents/photo_app/myen/bin/celery -A photo beat -l info
Restart=always
RestartSec=10

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

Steps to enable and start services

    Reload systemd to recognize new service files:

bash

Copy Code
sudo systemctl daemon-reload

    Enable services to start on boot:

bash

Copy Code
sudo systemctl enable celery-worker
sudo systemctl enable celery-beat

    Start services:

bash

Copy Code
sudo systemctl start celery-worker
sudo systemctl start celery-beat

    Check status:

bash

Copy Code
sudo systemctl status celery-worker
sudo systemctl status celery-beat

Notes

    Adjust User and Group if your Linux username is different.
    Make sure WorkingDirectory points to your Django project root (where manage.py is).
    ExecStart points to your virtualenv’s celery executable and your Django project name (photo).






















Setting up monitoring or alerts for Celery tasks.
Integrating task status checks in your Django admin or API.

Monitoring and Alerts for Celery Tasks: What, Why, and How
What is monitoring and alerting for Celery tasks?

    Monitoring means continuously tracking the health, performance, and status of your Celery workers and tasks.
    Alerts are notifications triggered when something goes wrong (e.g., task failures, worker crashes, high task latency).

Why is monitoring and alerting important?

    Reliability: Ensures your background tasks run smoothly without silent failures.
    Early detection: Quickly identify and fix issues before they impact users.
    Performance: Track task execution times and optimize bottlenecks.
    Visibility: Understand task throughput, success/failure rates, and system load.
    Compliance: For audit and operational requirements.

How to monitor and alert Celery tasks?
1. Use Celery’s built-in monitoring tools

    Flower: A popular real-time web-based tool for monitoring Celery clusters.
        Shows task progress, success/failure, worker status, and more.
        Easy to install and run alongside your Celery workers.

bash

Copy Code
pip install flower
celery -A photo flower

    Access Flower UI (default at http://localhost:5555).

2. Use logging and metrics

    Configure detailed logging in your Celery workers to capture task events.
    Export metrics (e.g., task duration, failure counts) to monitoring systems like Prometheus, Grafana.

3. Set up alerting

    Integrate with alerting tools (e.g., PagerDuty, Slack, email) to notify on task failures or worker downtime.
    Use Flower’s alerting plugins or external monitoring systems.

Integrating Task Status Checks in Django Admin or API
What and why?

    Provide visibility into background task status directly in your Django admin or via API endpoints.
    Useful for admins or support teams to check if tasks are running as expected.
    Can show task history, failures, retries, and current queue length.

How to implement?
1. Use Django models to log task events

    Create a model to store task metadata (task id, status, timestamps, result).
    Update this model from your Celery tasks or signals.

2. Use Celery result backend data

    Query the result backend (e.g., Redis, database) to get task statuses.
    Expose this info via Django admin or REST API.

3. Use third-party packages

    Packages like django-celery-results and django-celery-beat provide admin integration for task results and schedules.
    You already have django-celery-beat installed; consider adding django-celery-results for task result tracking.
